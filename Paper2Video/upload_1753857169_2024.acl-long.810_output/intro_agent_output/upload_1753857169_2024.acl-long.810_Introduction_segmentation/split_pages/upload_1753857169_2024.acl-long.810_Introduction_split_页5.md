In this paper, we propose ChatDev (see Figure 1), a chat-powered software-development framework integrating multiple "software agents" for active involvement in three core phases of the software lifecycle: design, coding, and testing. Technically, ChatDev uses a chat chain to divide each phase into smaller subtasks further, enabling agents' multi-turn communications to cooperatively propose and develop solutions (e.g.，creative ideas or source code). The chain-structured workflow guides agents on what to communicate, fostering cooperation and smoothly linking natural- and programming-language subtasks to propel problem solving.
