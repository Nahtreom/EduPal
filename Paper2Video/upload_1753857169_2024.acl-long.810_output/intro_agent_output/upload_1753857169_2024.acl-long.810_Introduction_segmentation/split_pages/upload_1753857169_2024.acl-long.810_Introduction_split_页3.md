Due to these technical inconsistencies, methods employed in different phases remain isolated until now. Every phase, from data collection and labeling to model training and inference, requires its unique designs, leading to a fragmented and less efficient development process in the field (Freeman et al., 2001; Ernst, 2017; Winkler et al., 2020). Motivated by the expert-like potential of autonomous agents, we aim to establish language as a unifying bridge—utilizing multiple LLM-powered agents with specialized roles for cooperative software development through language-based communication across different phases; solutions in different phases are derived from their multi-turn dialogues, whether dealing with text or code.
