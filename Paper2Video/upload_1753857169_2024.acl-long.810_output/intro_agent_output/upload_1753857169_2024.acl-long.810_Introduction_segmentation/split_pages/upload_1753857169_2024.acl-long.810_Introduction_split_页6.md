Additionally, to minimize coding hallucinations, ChatDev includes a communicative dehallucination mechanism, enabling agents to actively request more specific details before giving direct responses. The communication pattern instructs agents on how to communicate, enabling precise information exchange for effective solution optimization while reducing coding hallucinations. We built a comprehensive dataset containing software requirement descriptions and conducted comprehensive analyses. The results indicate that ChatDev notably improves the quality of software, leading to improved completeness, executability, and better consistency with requirements.
