Software development is a complex task that necessitates cooperation among multiple members with diverse skills (e.g.，architects, programmers, and testers) (Basili, 1989; Sawyer and Guinan, 1998). This entails extensive communication among different roles to understand and analyze requirements through natural language, while also encompassing development and debugging using programming languages (Ernst, 2O17; Banker et al., 1998). Numerous studies use deep learning to improve specific phases of the waterfall model in software development, such as design, coding, and testing (Pudlitz et al., 2019; Martin and Abran, 2015; Gao et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016).
