Large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial transformations due to their ability to effortlessly integrate extensive knowledge expressed in language (Brown et al., 2O2O; Bubeck et al.. 2023), combined with their strong capacity for roleplaying within designated roles (Park et al., 2023; Hua et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b). This advancement eliminates the need for model-specific designs and delivers impressive performance in diverse downstream applications. Furthermore, autonomous agents (Richards, 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a) have gained attention for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs with advanced features such as context-aware memory (Sumers et al., 2023), multistep planning (Liu et al., 2O23), and strategic tool using (Schick et al., 2023).
