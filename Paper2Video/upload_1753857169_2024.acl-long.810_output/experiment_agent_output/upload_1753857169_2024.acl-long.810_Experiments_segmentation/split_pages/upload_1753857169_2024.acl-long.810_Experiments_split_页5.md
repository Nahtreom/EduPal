MetricsEvaluating software is also a challenging task, especially when trying to assess it on a holistic level. Under the current limitation of scarce benchmark resources, traditional function-oriented code generation metrics (e.g.，pass@k),cannot seamlessly transfer to a comprehensive evaluation of entire software systems. The main reason for this is that it is often impractical to develop manual or automated test cases for various types of software, especially those involving complex interfaces, frequent user interactions,or non-deterministic feedback.
