DatasetsNote that, as of now, there isn't a publicly accessible dataset containing textual descriptions of software requirements in the context of agent-driven software development. To this end, we are actively working towards developing a comprehensive dataset for software requirement descriptions,which we refer to as SRDD (Software Requirement Description Dataset). Drawing on previous work (Li et al., 2O23a), we utilize existing software descriptions as initial examples,which are then further developed through a process that combines LLM-based automatic generation with post-processing refinement guided by humans.
