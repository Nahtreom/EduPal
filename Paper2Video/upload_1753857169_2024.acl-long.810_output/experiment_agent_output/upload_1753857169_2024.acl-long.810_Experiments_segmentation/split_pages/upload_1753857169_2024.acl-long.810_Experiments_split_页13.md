Implementation DetailsWe divided software development into 5 subtasks within 3 phases, assigning specific roles like CEO, CTO, programmer, reviewer, and tester. A subtask would terminate and get a conclusion either after two unchanged code modifications or after 1O rounds of communication.During the code completion, review, and testing,a communicative dehallucination is activated.
