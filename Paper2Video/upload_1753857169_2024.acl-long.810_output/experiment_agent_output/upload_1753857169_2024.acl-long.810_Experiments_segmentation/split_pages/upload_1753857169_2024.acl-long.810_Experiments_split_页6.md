As an initial strategy, we apply three fundamental and objective dimensions that reflect different aspects of coding hallucinations to evaluate the agent-generated software,and then integrate them to facilitate a more holistic evaluation: Completeness measures the software's ability to fulfill code completion in software development, quantified as the percentage of software without any "placeholder" code snippets.A higher score indicates a higher probability of automated completion.
