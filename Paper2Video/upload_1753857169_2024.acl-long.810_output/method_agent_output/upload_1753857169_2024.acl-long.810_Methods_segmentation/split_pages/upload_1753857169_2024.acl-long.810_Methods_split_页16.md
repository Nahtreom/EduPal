Specifically, a vanilla communication pattern between the assistant and the instructor follows a straightforward instruction-response format:

$$
\langle \mathcal { T } \to \mathcal { A } , \mathcal { A } \{ \mathcal { A } \} \emptyset
$$

In contrast, our communicative dehallucination mechanism features a deliberate "role reversal", where the assistant takes on an instructor-like role, proactively seeking more specific information (e.g., the precise name of an external dependency and its related class) before delivering a conclusive response.
