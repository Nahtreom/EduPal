After the instructor provides a specific modification suggestion, the assistant proceeds to perform precise optimization:

$$
\langle \mathcal { T } \to \mathcal { A } , \langle \mathcal { A } \to \mathcal { I } , \mathcal { I } \sim \mathcal { A } \rangle _ { \odot } , \mathcal { A } \sim \mathcal { I } \rangle _ { \odot }
$$

Since this mechanism tackles one concrete issue at a time, it requires multiple rounds of communication to optimize various potential problems. The communication pattern instructs agents on how to communicate, enabling finer-grained information exchange for effective solution optimization, which practically aids in reducing coding hallucinations.
